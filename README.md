* Gratus is a gratitude journaling app designed to help a user express and strengthen their gratitude, a virtue that's been studied and proven to improve overall well-being. After a user writes a journal reflection from a given prompt, the user completes a gratitude survey response. The app then generates future gratitude prompts for the user to write about from topics whose prompts have historically given the user high levels of gratitude in the past. This is done to ensure that a userâ€™s gratitude level stays high and that they continue to journal and thus improve their well-being.
